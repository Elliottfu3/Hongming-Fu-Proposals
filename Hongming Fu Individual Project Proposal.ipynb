    "**Key statistics and interesting findings in the database**\n",
    "First, I analyzed the data values of the database and summarized some useful information. First of all, regarding the demographic characteristics of this database, the average age of the participants in the survey is about 47 years old, ranging from 16 to 96 years old. At the same time, the survey sample contains a variety of gender or sexual orientation identities to ensure the diversity of the statistical survey. Next, I observed and counted the average score of life satisfaction, which is about 6.18 points, with a full score of 10 points. I think this shows that most people feel moderate or high satisfaction with life. To my surprise, there are large differences in the self-image and emotional control scores in mental health, which I think is caused by the different mentality of the participants. Finally, on the Big Five Personality Scale, the participants scored higher in openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness, while neuroticism and extraversion scored slightly lower. These data may indicate that individuals in the sample may be more inclined to innovative, reliable, and easygoing personality traits."

    "**Hypothesis**\n",
    "In the hypothesis section, I want to perform a one-sample mean hypothesis test on the variable `UNIQUE_num_records` to verify whether its mean is equal to a certain value. First, set the null hypothesis H0, which means that the population mean of `UNIQUE_num_records` is equal to a given value. Here, I set this value to 50. Then let the population mean be Œº, then the null hypothesis can be expressed as H0:Œº= 50 \\). The null hypothesis assumes that the mean is equal to a certain value, based on my initial theory, known benchmark values, or expected values. Then set the alternative hypothesis Ha: The alternative hypothesis is that the population mean of `UNIQUE_num_records` is not equal to the given value. Here I perform a two-tailed test, and I only investigate whether the mean is different from the given value. In the hypothesis section, the last test target is to calculate the Bootstrap confidence interval (CI) of the mean of the variable to determine whether the null hypothesis can be rejected. I calculate a 95% confidence interval. My conclusion is: if the confidence interval contains the hypothesized mean of 50, I do not reject H0 and believe that the data supports that the mean of `UNIQUE_num_records` may indeed be 50. However, if the confidence interval does not contain 50, I reject H0 and believe that the mean of `UNIQUE_num_records` is significantly different from 50.\n",
